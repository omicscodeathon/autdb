**Prepared data with IDglobal**

This folder contains all intermediate and final metadata tables used for downstream modeling, validation, and reproducibility of the AutDB study.
Each file in this folder represents a specific processing stage — from raw feature merging to final machine-learning-ready datasets with global IDs and predefined splits.

Folder contents and purpose

**MMASD basic.xlsx** - Preprocessed baseline table for the MMASD dataset, generated by build_mmasd_basic.py and compute_mmasd_features.py. Contains per-participant behavioral metrics derived from OpenPose skeletons (movement_intensity features).

**Engagnition basic.xlsx** - Preprocessed baseline table for the Engagnition dataset, generated by build_engagnition_basic.py and compute_eng_features.py. Includes aggregated Empatica E4 sensor signals and corresponding movement metrics.

metadata_master.xlsx - Unified metadata created by merging the two datasets (MMASD basic + Engagnition basic) via merge_tables.py. Contains harmonized columns and the dataset origin flag (dataset = MMASD / Engagnition). This file serves as the starting point for cleaning and global ID creation.

Metadata cleaning.ipynb	- Performs data cleaning and harmonization of metadata_master.xlsx.
• Removes duplicates and inconsistent IDs
• Unifies variable naming
• Creates participant_global_id linking both datasets
• Generates the cleaned table metadata_ml_ready.xlsx.

metadata_ml_ready.xlsx - Cleaned and standardized metadata ready for ML processing. Contains unified participant IDs, consistent column types, and verified targets (movement_intensity_z, movement_intensity_bin).

metadata_ml_ready_clean_2metrics.xlsx - Extended version of metadata_ml_ready.xlsx including two normalized metrics (z-score and bin-based proxy outcome) prepared for cross-dataset comparison.

metadata_ml_ready_splits.xlsx - Machine-learning-ready table with assigned dataset splits (train, val, test) for both IID and LODO strategies. Built using the splits_manifest.json.

schema.yaml - Formal description of all variables in metadata_ml_ready.xlsx: data types, feature groups, required columns, and target definition (movement_intensity_bin). Used for automated loading and validation in model training scripts.

schema.yaml.ipynb - Automatically generates and validates schema.yaml based on the cleaned metadata. Ensures that feature types and column names in Excel match the schema specification.

splits_manifest.json - Stores the fixed train/validation/test participant splits for two evaluation regimes:
• split_iid — random participant-level split (independent samples)
• split_lodo — Leave-One-Dataset-Out (train on MMASD, test on Engagnition, and vice versa).
These splits guarantee reproducible model benchmarking across runs.

Purpose of this stage


This folder defines the transition point between data preprocessing and model training.
All scripts and files here ensure:

Unification of datasets under a single metadata schema

Cleaning & validation of participant/session information

Global ID assignment across datasets

Schema definition for automated loading and type checking

Reproducible splits for IID and LODO evaluations


Reproducibility note

All files in this folder are self-contained.
Re-running the preprocessing pipeline (build_*, compute_*, and merge_tables.py) followed by Metadata cleaning.ipynb will reproduce the same tables and splits described in the manuscript, provided that the folder structure matches the repository layout.
